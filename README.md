Or build and run at the same time:

	cargo run --release configuration_file.ini

## Configuration file

Use a configuration file to specify all the parameters of the simulation.
See conf.ini for an example.

## Plots

Plot the energy, virial, density...  with plot.py: 

    python plot.py folder_of_the_simulation

Analyse the orbits with periode.py:

    python periode.py folder_of_the_simulation 

## Videos

You can make a video of the simulation with gnuplot.sh:
